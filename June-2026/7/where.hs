-- Where is a keyword or inbuilt function that can be used at runtime to generate a desired output. It can be very helpful when function calculation becomes complex.

-- Consider a scenario where your input is a complex expression with multiple parameters. In such cases, you can break the entire expression into small parts using the "where" clause.

-- In the following example, we are taking a complex mathematical expression. We will show how you can find the roots of a polynomial equation [x^2 - 8x + 6] using Haskell.

roots :: (Float, Float, Float) -> (Float, Float)
roots (a, b, c) = (x1, x2) where
    x1 = e + sqrt d / (2 * a)
    x2 = e - sqrt d / (2 * a)
    d = b * b - 4 * a * c
    e = -b / (2 * a)

main = do
    putStrLn "The roots of our polynomial equation are:"
    print (roots (1, -8, 6))
